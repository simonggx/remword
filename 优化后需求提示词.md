   - Store marked vocabulary in a local SQLite database
   - Include the following data for each word: original word, translation, context sentence, source URL, timestamp

3. **Practice Exercise Generation**:
   - Generate different types of practice exercises based on saved vocabulary:
     - Multiple choice questions
     - Fill-in-the-blank exercises
     - Word-definition matching
     - Context-based usage questions
   - Allow users to review and practice their saved vocabulary

4. **Technical Requirements**:
   - Use Chrome Extension Manifest V3
   - Implement content scripts for text selection and overlay display
   - Use SQLite for local data storage (via Web SQL or IndexedDB)
   - Create a popup interface for vocabulary management and practice
   - Ensure the extension works across different websites

5. **User Interface**:
   - Clean, intuitive popup that appears when text is selected
   - Dedicated options page for vocabulary review and practice
   - Progress tracking for vocabulary learning

Please implement this as a complete Chrome extension with proper file structure, manifest.json, and all necessary components.
